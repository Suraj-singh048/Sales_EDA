# Supermarket Sales EDA Project

## Project Overview

This project assesses skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and basic predictive modeling using supermarket sales data. The aim is to derive meaningful insights from the data and build a model to predict purchase costs based on various factors.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about supermarket sales, including:
- **Purchase Date**
- **Product Category**
- **Quantity Sold**
- **Unit Price**
- **Total Cost**
- **Payment Method**
- **Branch Location**

You can download the dataset [here](#).

## Task Outline

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Handle Missing Values:** Identify and address any gaps in the data.
- **Remove Duplicates:** Ensure the dataset contains unique entries.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identify and treat outliers as necessary.
- **Data Type Conversion:** Format data types appropriately (e.g., converting dates).
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Generate key statistics, such as average unit price and total sales per branch.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trends Analysis:** 
  - Plot total sales by month and branch to identify seasonal or branch-specific trends.
- **Category Insights:** 
  - Analyze and visualize the top product categories based on quantity sold and revenue.
- **Customer Insights:** 
  - Examine payment method usage across branches and visualize patterns (e.g., cash vs. credit card).

### 3. Basic Predictive Modeling
- **Objective:** Predict the total cost of a purchase using factors like product category, quantity, unit price, and branch.
- **Approach:** 
  - Split the dataset into training and test sets.
  - Build a predictive model using linear regression or decision trees.
- **Evaluation:** 
  - Assess model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 4. Insights and Recommendations
- **Summary of Findings:** 
  - Highlight insights from EDA, such as the best-performing branches and high-revenue product categories.
- **Recommendations:** 
  - Provide 2-3 actionable recommendations, including promotional strategies for high-demand categories and suggestions for popular payment methods.

## Submission Guidelines

- **Deliverables:** 
  - A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) containing detailed steps of the analysis.
  - A one-page summary of key insights and recommendations.

- **Evaluation Criteria:** 
  - Quality of data preparation.
  - Skills demonstrated in exploratory data analysis.
  - Performance of the predictive model.
  - Clarity and applicability of insights and recommendations.
